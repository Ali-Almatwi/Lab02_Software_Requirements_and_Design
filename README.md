## Overview
This school management system is designed to represent a university and the various entities within university classes. It provides a detailed composition of how university classes are structured, encompassing both students and lecturers.

## Features
- **University Representation**: The system models the structure of a university, highlighting the interaction between students and lecturers in various classes.
- **Students**: This feature represents students enrolled in different courses within a university class. Courses include Computer Science, Information Technology, and Engineering.
- **Lecturers**: Lecturers are responsible for teaching students. The system models the relationship where each lecturer can teach a specific course, while students may enroll in multiple courses.

### Plugin Testing
**Error Encountered**: In the fourth task of the project, an error was encountered related to the DSL.UI folder. Despite successful completion of the first three tasks, this issue arose during plugin export and testing. The linked documentation provided insufficient instructions for resolving this issue, leading to challenges in accurately addressing the problem.
